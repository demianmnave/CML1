CML version 1.0 20080326

* Macro fixes for Visual Studio 8 and 9.

* Added support for quaternion log() and exp().

* Fixed quaternion slerp() to work transparently with quaternion expressions.

* Fixed quaternion_rotation_difference() to work transparently with
  quaternion expressions.

* Fixed line endings and made sure files have trailing newlines.

* Added inverse determinant optimization.

* Added integer-based vector and matrix types.

* Removed support for quaternion division.

* Fixed header include order for GCC4.

* Replaced switch-case in QuaternionMulOp::operator[] with a temporary
  computed in the constructor.

* Changed multiplication mechanism to remove extra multiplications by
 'scale' constant

* Added six 'matrix decomposition' functions

* Added "cml::" prefix to a number of free-function calls from vector<> and
  matrix<> methods that VS8 incorrectly tries to match with methods in
  those classes having the same names as (but different arguments from) the
  free functions.

* Added 'tolerance' argument to quaternion_to_euler() function


* Added PLANE_ prefix to enums to avoid symbol conflict with Windows macros
  LEFT and RIGHT

* Fixed bug in ScalarPromote code; now implements the C promotion rules
  (see test/integer_vectors.cpp).


CML version 1.0 20090314

* Replaced ScalarPromote<> with more robust code from
http://ubiety.uwaterloo.ca/~tveldhui/papers/techniques/techniques01.html

* Fixed a bug in MatrixPromote<> due to a dependence upon broken behavior
of the previous ScalarPromote<> code.
