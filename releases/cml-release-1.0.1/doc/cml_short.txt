Existing 3D game/graphics math libraries make assumptions on the
form and/or function of the mathematical objects they implement.
For example, a common design decision is to choose either row or
column vectors, and impose that decision across the entire
implementation.  The purpose of the Configurable Math Library
(CML) is to eliminate as many assumptions as possible, thereby
allowing you to choose the mathematical programming paradigm your
are most familiar with.
